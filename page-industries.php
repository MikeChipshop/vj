                    <h1>VJ Industries</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>VJ Technologies (VJT) is a leader in the design and construction of deployable, high-energy x-ray containment vaults for the nuclear industry.</p>
                            <p>VJT provides services and equipment dedicated to the national clean-up and remediation of low-level nuclear waste. Our services cover a variety of inspection applications, such as castings used in land-based turbine engines and nuclear plant builds.</p>
                            <p>VJT provides Mobile Lab Services for nuclear characterization. Our technology penetrates very high-density materials, including concrete and metals up to 16 inches thick. This capability facilitates the x-ray inspection validation of new-build materials and components for nuclear facilities.</p>
                            <p>VJT also provides systems and services to the nuclear industry for the characterization of low-level waste (LLW) and transuranic waste (TRU), prior to disposal.</p>
                            <p>VJT solutions use high-resolution NDE radiography techniques to inspect and characterize the composition of drum and box contents and to provide detailed images and analysis.</p>
                            <p>VJT uses its expertise in complex technology integration to provide technology-based solutions and services to the global nuclear industry. Inspection and quality checking to validate build-quality is an essential part of nuclear facility construction.</p>
                            <p>In addition to inspection services and equipment, VJTâ€™s High Energy facility is used extensively for a wide variety of radiation exposure testing requirements. We can tightly control dose rates to replicate specific exposure levels and to achieve accumulated dose rates. This facilitates accelerated life-cycle testing of components used in environments where radiation levels are important.</p>
                            <p>VJT provides site remediation technology and equipment development services, together with the design, build and full scale, cold testing of remediation equipment and systems.</p>
